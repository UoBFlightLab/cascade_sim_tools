T'was a bit of a pain getting FGMS (the server) installed and configured on AWS.  Here are some notes.

1. Start a t2.micro Amazon Linux instance.
2. Create and apply a new security group to enable inbound UDP traffic on port 5000 and TCP traffic on 5001
3. SSH to the instance, using an AWS key-pair and logging in as ec2-user (no password as it's done by keys)
4. sudo yum install cmake make gcc gcc-g++ git
5. git clone fgms
6. In the CMakeLists file, change the first project to say "PROJECT (fgms C CXX)" [avoid pthread bug]
7. Follow the FGMS install instructions
8. Configure the server.address line in the config to be the *private* IP address from ifconfig (use util sh)
9. Run the thing with the config file just edited
10. Can logout if running as Daemon
11. telnet to the *public* IP address on port 5001 and you should get a little status message
